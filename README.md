Auto EDA With Python

## Introduction to EDA : 

EDA is a data analysis process, where multiple techniques are used to better understand the dataset being used. It is basically used to identify a human error, missing values, or outliers. It extracts useful variables and removes useless variables. It is used to understand the relationship between variables or features. It ultimately maximizes your insights into a dataset and minimizes potential errors later in the process.

## What is SweetViz Library?
SweetViz Library is an open-source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA with just two lines of code. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application. The system is built around quickly visualizing target values and comparing datasets. Its goal is to help quick analysis of target characteristics, training vs testing data, and other such data characterization tasks.

 

## Some of the features of SweetViz Library

1- It shows how a target value(dependent features) relates to other features.

2- It integrates associations for numerical (Pearsonâ€™s correlation), categorical (uncertainty coefficient), and categorical-numerical (correlation ratio) datatypes seamlessly, to provide maximum information for all data types.

3- It automatically detects numerical, categorical, and text features, with optional manual overrides.

4- Summary information about the type, unique values, missing values, duplicate rows, most frequent values.

5- Numeric Analysis such as min/max/range, quartiles, mean, mode, standard deviation, sum, median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness.
